### Hi!

- 👋 My name is María Eugenia (she/her) but most people call me Maru. I'm a self-taught front-end developer who is passionate about learning new technologies & building things.

- 🌱 These are the three projects I'm most proud of so far: [CSS Flexbox](https://github.com/marugy99/flexbox-doc), [Retro Tasks](https://github.com/marugy99/retro-tasks), [Film Match](https://github.com/marugy99/film-match). Also, here's my [personal website](https://marucodes.com/).

- 🌟 I love art, design, video games and filming silly videos in my spare time 📽️ (which I post on my [Twitter](https://twitter.com/MaruLucenaT)).
